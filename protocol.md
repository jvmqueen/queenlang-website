# Queen's Protocol

In the effort of implementing real object-oriented applications, the Queen programming language comes with a strict set of rules.

1. Any public method of a class should be declared in an interface.
2. A class is either abstract or final.
3. No static stuff. Queen doesn't even have the **static** keyword.
4. No null! Queen does not have the concept of null. Instead, in Queen, we say that an object is **missing**. 
5. All variables (class attributes or method variables) are final -- they can be attributed only once.
6. Naming restrictions. For instance, variables must have at least 3 characters in their name.
... more to come.
